Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is seeking to implement their game, Draw It or Lose It, in a web-based environment that can be played on myltiple platforms. It is currently only available in an adroind app.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel i at least did well at explaining an overview of the software, its requirements, and different options.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating a document while also developing the code is something that i have no had much experience with. Getting to go through that process helped me to think about why the code was being written, its purpose.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Overall, I would choose to give more in-depth explanations of everything. Whether it was explaining the program itself or the recommendations.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Obviously, it is import to understand the user's needs. Without thinking about that, the program may never work as intended. A working program could still be built, but that is not the point.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I did not try to reinvent the wheel. What I was attempting to do has already been done so i Spent time researching a proper way toe write the code. After finding several good choices, I took the parts that would work best for the program and the user.
